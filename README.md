## Cloud Quinn BrightHR code kata

Task
We have a section of our app where users can access documents that administrators have uploaded. Please make a web page which will do the following...
1. Display the files/folders
2. Allow a user to open a folder to see itâ€™s contents
3. Sort by name/size/date
4. Filter by filename

The recommended timebox was about an hour. I was able to complete tasks 1 and 2.
